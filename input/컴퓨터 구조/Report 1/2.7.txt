ÄÄ±¸Á¶ 2.7
Now assume that the program can be executed in eight parallel tasks or threads with roughly equal number of instructions executed in each task.
Execution is on an 8-core system with each core (processor) having the same performance as the single processor originally used.
Coordination and synchronization between the parts adds an extra 25,000 instruction executions to each task.
Report 1
Assume the same instruction mix as in the example for each task,
but increase the CPI for memory reference with cache miss to 12 cycles due to contention for memory
